# Firefox tab recovery from stg backup file
A tool to get all open tabs in all groups from a backup.json from the Firefox extension [SimpleTabGroups](https://github.com/drive4ik/simple-tab-groups).  
It will create a folder "files" in the same directory as the Python script containing a text file for every group in the backup file.  
Each file contains the open tabs in the group line by line.   
The last link in the file is newest one.
